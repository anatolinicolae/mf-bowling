# Bowling game tracker

Tracks rolls by frame and provides a final score, including spares and strikes.

## Installation

Cloning the repo and opening it in IntelliJ IEAD should work OOTB.

## Testing

Run either `Main.kt` or the `BowlingTests` class through IntelliJ IDEA. `Main.kt` allows to see intermediate scores via flag, while `BowlingTests` class asserts score correctness at game end.
